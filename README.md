## Description
This repository contains the source code for my Chinese volunteer website. The purpose of the website was to contain all previously recorded Chiense culture presentations that I had done for the AP curriculumn. These recorded presentations served as an example for AP students to reference while practicing for each possible topic, with visual aid and short descriptions in both Chinese and English. There is also an activities page in which the student can select from a number of topics and be met with essential questions from the lessons relating to the topic(s) selected. In addition to basic knowledge of HTML, website showcases good formatting and styling with CSS in addition to friendly user interactivity with JavaScript code.

Includes a home page, activities page (essential questions), videos page (AP culture presentation example recordings), and an about page.

Website has retired use with the ending of my Chinese volunteer, since future volunteers make their own.
