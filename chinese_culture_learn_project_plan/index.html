          <h2>Overview and Intended Audience</h2>
          <p>
            My goal with this website is to revamp one of the older websites I made u sing Wix
            which was to share culture presentation videos on Chinese. This means that it will
            basically contain a lot of videos with descriptions on what the video will contain.
            I will also want to include some sort of "form" that can be used to like/dislike the 
            video. I will be organizing the videos into categories as well, which may lead to 
            sub-pages being created. The intended audience is Chinese learners at my old Chinese 
            school to learn more about culture-related topics for their presentations.

          <h2>CSS and Look</h2>
          <p>
            The color palette for this will most likely be a combination of yellows, reds, as well
            as black and white to suit the theme of my website. My font will most likely be a typical
            and easy-to-read font like Palatino, Sofia Pro, and Barlow to make it look clean and
            simple to understand.

          <h2>SEO Keywords</h2>
          <p>
            The keywords I planned to use were "Chinese culture", "Ethnic cultures", "learning 
            Chinese", etc. Some websites I found with these keywords were 
            <a href="https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/culture/">China Highlights</a> and
            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/China">Britannica</a>.

        <div class="reveal fade-right">
          <h2>User Experience Improvement and Probabiblity Increase</h2>
          <p>
            I will also include a title tag, website description, image alts, viewport, and more to
            increase traffic and improve User Experience. I'm also thinking of adding a couple mini
            animations as well to keep the user engaged in the website as they hover/scroll on the 
            website.
